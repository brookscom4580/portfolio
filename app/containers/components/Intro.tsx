        <h2>Software Engineering Leader</h2>
        <p>
          As a Software Engineering Manager, I lead a team of
          full-stack engineers who work on various technical projects. I have
          over 10 years of experience in web development, using technologies
          such as JavaScript (Node/TS/React/Vue), HTML, CSS, Docker, and AWS.
          <br/><br/>
          My goals are to help my team achieve engineering excellence, foster a
          culture of learning and growth, and deliver high-quality solutions
          that create value for our clients. I mentor, coach, and support my
          engineers, while also contributing to the code base and the system
          design and architecture. I collaborate with other engineering leaders,
          product owners/managers, and stakeholders to ensure alignment and
          coordination of our efforts. I am passionate about web development,
          and I constantly seek to improve my skills and learn new technologies
          and best practices.
